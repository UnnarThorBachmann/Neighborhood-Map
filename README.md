#Neighborhood Map

This is a project done by Unnar Thor Bachmann in the Udacity's front-developing course.

This project involves a construction of a neighborhood map using

1. the Knockout framwork.
2. Google maps.
3. ajax calls to Wikipedia.

##Short explanation of functionality.

The neighborhood map is a map of Borgarbyggð county in Iceland. Few famous places are marked on the map. Each place is stored in an obersvable array as the 3-tuple: name, location and marker. Displays the most relevent Wikipedia links when a marker is pressed, allows filtering in the input box and animates the marker pressed.

##How to run the webpage.

1. Open the index.html file in the project folder in a web browser to run the website.
