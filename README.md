This is a project done by Unnar Thor Bachmann in the Udacity's front-developing course.

This project involves a construction of a neighborhood map using
a) the knockout framwork.
b) Google maps.
c) ajax calls to Wikipedia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short explanation of functionality.

The neighborhood map is a map of Borgarbyggð county in Iceland. Few famous places are marked on the map. Each place is stored in an obersvable array as the 3-tuple: name, location and marker. Displays the most relevent Wikipedia links when a marker is pressed, allows filtering in the input box and animates the marker pressed.
